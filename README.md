## Fading LED



### Description
This was the first project that we did on adruino. It required coding, breadboard, arduino, wires, and a cable. The wiring didn't take much time, but the coding needed to be fixed. The coding had(**if statments**) for making the serial monitor to sync with the LED fading.

### Reflection
This was a really fun project to do. I ran into some coding problems where I coulding get the LED to fade. But I finally figured it out with some help for my teacher. I was missing some of the (**for statments**) and (**Serial.print(ln)**) I had to add those in order to get this LED fading in and out, and having the serial monitor printing what is happening while the LED is fading.
