## Fading LED



### Description
This was the first project that we did on adruino. It required coding, breadboard, arduino, wires, and a cable. The wiring didn't take much time, but the coding needed to be fixed. The coding had(**if statments**) for making the serial monitor to sync with the LED fading.
