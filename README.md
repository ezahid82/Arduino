## Fading LED



### Description
This was the first project that we did on adruino. It required coding, breadboard, arduino, wires, and a cable. The wiring didn't take much time, but the coding needed to be fixed. The coding had(**if statments**) for making the serial monitor to sync with the LED fading.

### Reflection
This was a really fun project to do. I ran into some coding problems where I coulding get the LED to fade. But I finally figured it out with some help for my teacher. I was missing some of the (**for statments**) and (**Serial.print(ln)**) I had to add those in order to get this LED fading in and out, and having the serial monitor printing what is happening while the LED is fading.

## Finite L.E.D.


### Description

This is the second assignement for the Arduino course. The L.E.D. turns on and off five times, then delays for 5 seconds, and repeats the process. I used new codes like (**digitalWrite**) (**Counter++**) and (**pinMode**). the counter is used to count the number of times the L.E.D. will blink, the pinMode is used to show what pin to use, digitalWrite is used to turn the L.E.D. on and off.

### Reflection

this assignment was kind of hard at first. but I started to just code randomly with (**Counter++**) and somehow the assignment was related to that code. I contined to work on it by adding some (**if**) statements and (**digitalWrites**) which helped turn the L.E.D. on and off.
